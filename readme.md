# Mojibar

A menubar app adaptation of [Emoji searcher](http://emoji.muan.co).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:**
>
> This is a detached fork of the original [Mojibar](https://github.com/muan), which has been archived. This fork is a little more up-to-date, with updated emojilib version and audits the other packages, though lacking an offical release at the moment.
>
> For now, you can just copy the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files into the app. You can do this be first making sure the app is closed (`cmd`+`q` when the emoji selector is open) and then right-clicking on the app icon in Applications and then selecting "Show Package Contents", then root to `Contents > Resources > app`. Replace the two files there.
